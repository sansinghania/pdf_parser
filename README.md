# pdf_parser
A pdf parser that identifes words, sentenses, sections/layout of the pdf.

Intention of this project is to do a PoC to parse a given pdf document and identify the layout and text of the document. 
The text can then be logically grouped and fed to ML/AI APIs to get more relavant results. The implementation make use of following libraries
- Python Flask - to build the front end for users to select a PDF file
- pdfminer
- jasonpath - to be able to parse json strings
